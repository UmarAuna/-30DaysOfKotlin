## The #30DaysOfKotlin organized by Kotlin Kano User group

The #30DaysOfKotlin challenge is going to start on the 1st of October 2020. The goal of this challenge is to encourage developers to learn and be proficient in the Kotlin language, and also help newbies start working on projects using Kotlin. Participants are expected to sacrifice at least one hour every day to learn the core kotlin. 

## What is expected of participants
* Follow the Kotlin Kano Usergroup on Twitter.
* Indicate your interest to join the challenge by RSVP [here](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-Kano-User-Group-Nigeria/events/273211014/).
* Tweet on twitter using the **#30daysofkotlin #KanoKotlin, @KanoKotlin,** hashtags to help us keep track of your progress. 
* Write about how you've decided to join **#30DaysOfKotlin** to help us keep track of your progress. If you are wondering why you need to do this, studies have shown that people tend to complete whatever they said they will do if they made a **public announcement** about it. 

## Before the challenge starts
Participants are expected to: 

* choose the particular flow or tutorials they want to learn, 
Set a goal.
* Decide on the particular time that they want to work on the challenge each day. 
* Then finally set out a strategy to achieve the said goals because this will serve as a guide and keep participants focused on the goal for the next 30 days. We strongly advise candidates to set goals that will really improve your skills as a developer once they achieve it.
